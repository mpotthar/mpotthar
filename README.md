# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at 42 Wolfsburg, a tuition-free software engineering school that offers a cutting-edge gamified curriculum and a supportive ecosystem that nurtures an entrepreneurial spirit. I'm passionate about coding and learning new technologies.

Before joining 42 Wolfsburg, I completed an apprenticeship as a computer science expert for system integration. I gained valuable experience in designing, installing and maintaining IT systems and networks.

At 42 Wolfsburg, I'm learning coding from scratch in C, data structures, algorithms, and other fundamental concepts of computer science. I'm also working on various projects with my peers, using a peer-to-peer and project-based learning approach. I love the challenge and the freedom that 42 Wolfsburg offers me.

I'm interested in the future of mobility, industry 4.0, and cybersecurity. I think these are exciting fields that require innovative solutions and creative thinking. I'm looking forward to exploring them more in depth as I progress through the 42 Wolfsburg curriculum.

I love working on projects with my peers and solving real-world problems with code. Feel free to check out my projects and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelpottharst/). I'm always open to feedback, collaboration, and new opportunities. Thanks for visiting my profile!
